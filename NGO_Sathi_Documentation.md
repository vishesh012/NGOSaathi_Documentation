## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of This Documentation

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to NGO Sathi, covering its features, architecture, business model, and technical specifications. It is intended for developers, investors, and stakeholders interested in understanding the project in depth.

### About NGO Sathi

NGO Sathi is a web-based platform designed to aggregate NGOs, providing detailed insights into their services, needs, and ways to contribute. The goal is to bridge the gap between NGOs and potential donors/volunteers, making social impact more accessible and efficient.

### Problem Statement & Vision

Many NGOs struggle with visibility and resource management, making it difficult for them to connect with donors and volunteers. NGO Sathi solves this by offering a **centralized digital platform** where NGOs can showcase their missions, and individuals or organizations can find NGOs to support.
